# Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
Web Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to identify common web vulnerabilities, making it suitable for both beginners and professionals in the cybersecurity field. It automates the process of detecting issues such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in web applications, providing users with an accessible and efficient security testing solution.

## Features
- **Web Crawling:** Efficiently fetch and parse web pages to discover links and potential attack vectors.
- **SQL Injection Detection:** Identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting payloads and analyzing responses.
- **XSS Detection:** Detect Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities by injecting script payloads and analyzing responses.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed reports of identified vulnerabilities, aiding in remediation efforts.
- **Debugging and Logging:** Clear logging for each step of the scanning process facilitates debugging and ensures transparency.
